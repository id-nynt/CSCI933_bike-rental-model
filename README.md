# CSCI933_bike-rental-model
By studying a real-world bike-sharing dataset, this report compares traditional statistical learning and deep learning in demonstrating a linear regression task. Particularly, we analyze the implementation of linear regression models with various regularization techniques to assess their performance. The evaluation reveals that all statistical models perform similarly with R^2 values of 0.94, while deep learning models prove unsuitable for this task, with negative R^2. These results demonstrate the trade-offs between both approaches, proposing that while deep learning can effectively handle complex datasets, statistical learning is still powerful in processing simple structured datasets.
